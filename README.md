### Overview

In a study sponsored by Improbable Beef, volunteer subjects submitted bellybutton swabs for microbial analysis.  The bacterial populations were identified and quantified.  An app was created which allows the subject to look up the results by 'Test Subject ID No.'  The results include the subject's demographics, the bellybutton wash frequency, the top ten bacterial colonies by OTU id, and number of cultures per sample.

Visit the app at the above link and then select a Test Subject ID No. from the dropdown menu at the left-hand side to see the corresponding results.
